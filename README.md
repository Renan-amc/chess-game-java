## Understanding the interface
<img src="images/ImageChess1.png" width="500px">
The chess game is always shown above, then we have the pieces captured from the game, both white and black (yellow) because the background of the terminal is already black, every round will be shown by its turn and together with the turn of the player that would be the white or black pieces.

To start, enter column (a, b, c, d...) + row (1, 2, 3, 4...) As an example **source: a2** after entering your chosen piece, it will show the possible positions for moving. <a href="#image-possible-movements">Possible movements of the pieces</a>, then enter the target position of the chosen part and so on.
